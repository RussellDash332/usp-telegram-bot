BATCH PROJECT 2021 Amazing Race Bot. Implemented similar to [Royal Flush Telegram Bot](https://github.com/puzzlestory/t-royal-flush-telegram-bot)

[Link to the bot](https://matias.ma/nsfw/) here.

## How it works
The [**main.py**](https://github.com/RussellDash332/usp-telegram-bot/blob/main/main.py) file contains the regular commands such as ```/start``` and ```/meter```. It will then lead you to [**activities_menu.py**](https://github.com/RussellDash332/usp-telegram-bot/blob/main/activities_menu.py) where it contains the main activity conversation handler and query handlers related to the ```/activities``` command. Inside is a list of methods handling different cases and options, depending on the user, such as retrying a trivia question or finishing a game.

The activities are stored in a object-oriented manner inside [**cmd_base.py**](https://github.com/RussellDash332/usp-telegram-bot/blob/main/cmd_base.py). In that same file, there are also methods regarding progress update because it has to be continuously updated with the DontPad database.

Finally, reading/writing the JSON-styled database from/to DontPad is implemented in [**dpad_manager.py**](https://github.com/RussellDash332/usp-telegram-bot/blob/main/dpad_manager.py).

## Hidden files
+ **bot_data/** directory, containing the bot data (**bot_data.json**) and the images/texts (either in .jpg or .txt format) for the description.
+ **env.py**, containing the bot token **TOKEN** and the DontPad URL **DP_URL**.

## Deploying
This bot is currently deployed with Google Cloud SDK. Follow the provided guide to install GCloud SDK and prepare your terminal on this directory. On **main.py**, provide this function to be the first point of compilation.

```
def FUNCTION_NAME(request):
    # Define the bot
    updater = Updater(token=TOKEN, use_context=True)

    if request.method == 'POST':
        <Some commands>

    return <Message>
```

Provide certain modules to be imported along with the versions inside **requirements.txt**, for example

```
python-telegram-bot==13.4.1
```

#### First Deploy
Create a new project in Google Cloud, store it's name in ```<PROJECT-ID>```. Run this command on your terminal and replace ```<TOKEN>``` with your bot API token.

```
gcloud functions deploy FUNCTION_NAME --set-env-vars "TELEGRAM_TOKEN=<TOKEN>" --runtime python38 --trigger-http --project=<PROJECT-ID>
```

Once the deploy finishes (around 2 minutes), it will provide you an URL for the webhook setup. Copy the URL as ```<URL>``` and run this command.

```
curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=<URL>"
```

#### Re-deploying
Should you apply some changes in your code, you can re-deploy your bot using a similar command.

```
gcloud functions deploy FUNCTION_NAME --runtime python38 --trigger-http --project=<PROJECT-ID>
```

For double check, set the webhook again.

```
curl "https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/setWebhook?url=<URL>"
```
